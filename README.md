# AI-3D-Pathfinding-Mars-NASA
Developed 3D models from NASAâ€™s 2D Martian maps and designed an AI-powered rover. Using informed and local algorithms, it navigated challenging terrain, traversed maps, and descended into craters, avoiding obstacles like tall rocks. The project showcased AI-driven pathfinding in simulated Martian exploration.
